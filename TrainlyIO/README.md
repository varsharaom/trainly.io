# Trainly.io, a startup looking to disrupt the training industry. While still in beta, the mission of Trainly.io is to be the App Store of training: organizations collaborate with faculty to create and securely post materials (for free!); students find, enroll in, and complete useful courses (with the ability to certify completion to employers); and Trainly.io only charges 30% of any course-enrollment fees!
